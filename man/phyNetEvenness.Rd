  x,
  row.tree = NULL,
  col.tree = NULL,
  q = seq(0, 2, 0.2),
  datatype = "abundance",
  method = "Estimated",
  nboot = 30,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix/data.frame/list/vector of abundances-based/incidences-based species data.\cr}

\item{q}{a integer vector of the order of Hill number\cr}

\item{datatype}{data type of input data: individual-based abundance data (\code{datatype = "abundance"}),
sampling-unit-based incidence frequencies data (\code{datatype = "incidence_freq"}) or species by sampling-units incidence matrix (\code{datatype = "incidence_raw"}).\cr}

\item{method}{a binary calculation method with 'Estimated' or 'Empirical'\cr}

\item{nboot}{an integer specifying the number of bootstrap replications, default is 30.\cr}

\item{conf}{a positive number < 1 specifying the level of confidence interval, default is 0.95.\cr}

\item{E.class}{a integer vector between 1 to 6}

\item{C}{a standardized coverage for calculating evenness index}
}
\value{
A list of estimated(empirical) evenness with order q.\cr
        Different lists represents different classes of Evenness.\cr
        Each list is combined with order.q and sites.\cr
        If "method" is estimated, then fist list will be named "C" which means the
        maximum standardized coverage between all double reference sample size.\cr\cr
\code{$summary} individual summary of 4 steps of data. \cr\cr
